# About
Our team is planning on developing a lightweight, browser-based, arcade style side scrolling game based on Mars. The idea at the moment is to have our lord and savior Elon Musk to progress through levels earning xp by defeating common enemies until you reach enough xp to spawn a level boss to defeat to move on to the next level.

# Dependencies
To implement this project, we will take advantage of the Phaser JavaScript library. Phaser is a JavaScript library for making HTML5 games for desktops and mobile browsers. This library provides many useful methods that will allow us to create complex scenes and structures without having to implement it in raw html or write everything from scratch in JavaScript.

# Features
Our features will include four progressive levels, each level in a different setting. Each level will feature common enemies as well as a main boss. Other possible features that we will implement include having an inventory, health bar, XP, multiple weapons, consumables, and equipment. Since our setting is the planet Mars, radiation is one factor that we will have to address. To address this issue, enemies will drop medicine to increase our decreasing health. As of now, a reward for defeating the first boss is a spacesuit that will protect our protagonist from radiation poisoning.
